# Hello!<br/> <small>My name is Oleh Dutchenko,<br data-hide="in-sm-container" /> I'm a frontend developer!</small>

I like working with React, TypeScript and GraphQL. I'm interested in the concept
of "Clean Code" and the practical implementation of it. Especially, I
like "Test-Driven Development" (TDD), which I
actively use in my work.

On this website I talk about my experience as a tech lead and express my
thoughts on technologies, practices and methodologies.

I invite you to visit my [blog](/blog) or learn more [about me](/about). Maybe
you will be interested in [the code that I post on Envato](/envato).

I hope my experience, knowledge and services will be useful to you.
