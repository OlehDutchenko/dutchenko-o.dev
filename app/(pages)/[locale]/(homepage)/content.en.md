# Hello!<br> <small>My name is Oleg Dutchenko, and I'm a frontend developer!</small>

I like to work with React, TypeScript and GraphQL. I'm interested in the concept
of "Clean Code" and practices of its
implementation. Especially, I like "Test-Driven Development" (TDD), which I
actively use in my tasks.

On this site, I talk about my experience of commercial work as a tech lead and
share my thoughts on technologies, practices and methodologies.

You can read my [blog](/blog) or learn more [about me](/about).  
Perhaps you will be interested in [the code I sell on Envato](/envato).

I hope my experience, knowledge and services will be useful to you.
